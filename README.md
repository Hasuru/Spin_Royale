# SPIN ROYALE

## Introduction
Spin Royale is a tiny Unity project consisting in making a simple slot machine.

## Context
The game was made with a focus in the UI/UX experience from a user perspective.
Attention to good ways to guide the attention and the eyes of the player were taken into account.
This is also a tiny project just to grow the UI/UX skills.

## The Game
The game offers fixed Credit and Bet values for coin management, a prizes table that tells the player the prize table, a box for winnings or loses communication and finally animation and development of the slot machine itself, something to keep the player's eyes busy during the game.

## Assets
Majority of the assets found in the UI were own-made, with exception from the fruit sprites that were found in the Unity Asset Shop.

## Deployment
Currently the game still does not have a built version, but one can always clone the repo and test it from the Unity Editor.
A built version is expected to be linked to this project when the testing phase ends.
